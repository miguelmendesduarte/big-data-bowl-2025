    "# I. Introduction\n",
    "In modern NFL defenses, **defensive backs** (DBs) are vital players in both coverage and pressure schemes. While their primary role is often in pass coverage, they also play a significant part in blitz packages. A well-executed DB blitz can disrupt the offense by confusing the quarterback and offensive line with unexpected pressure. Success in these situations relies on timing and the DB's ability to disguise their intentions. Disguising coverage is another essential skill for DBs. By showing one defensive look pre-snap and shifting to another post-snap, they can mislead quarterbacks and force poor decisions, leading to incompletions, sacks, or even turnovers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this dynamic, consider Jaire Alexander (#23), the Packers' cornerback, in a key play against the Vikings (Figure 1). With a clever disguise, Alexander blitzed and sacked Kirk Cousins for a safety, demonstrating how effective deception can impact the game.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "But how good was the disguise? Could the offense have predicted and adjusted their blocking to account for his blitz? The ability to disguise intentions can force the offense into a rushed decision or a missed block, which may not always be reflected in immediate statistics like sacks or turnovers, but can still significantly influence the outcome of a play. By quantifying these subtle influences, we can better understand how much of a DB's success comes from strategic deception, rather than pure physical skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises two key questions: **Can we quantitatively measure how effectively a DB disguises his intentions?** And more importantly, **how much does a successful disguise lead to tangible improvements in defensive outcomes?** In the following sections, we will explore these questions by analyzing data, applying a classification algorithm, creating a **disguise metric**, and examining the resulting insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section II outlines the steps taken to clean and process the data, introduces the classification algorithm used, and explains the training process. In Section III, we present and analyze the results, addressing the key questions raised earlier. Finally, Section IV summarizes the main conclusions of this work and suggests potential directions for future research."

    "# II. Methodology\n",
    "This study aims to quantitatively measure how effectively a DB disguises his intentions pre-snap and how this impacts defensive outcomes. To achieve this, a machine learning model is trained using pre-snap data to predict the likelihood of a blitz. The predicted blitz probabilities are then compared to the DB's post-snap actions (blitz or coverage) to assess the alignment between the predicted and actual outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The analysis focuses on cornerback behavior during pass plays, so all non-passing plays, QB kneels, and designed rollouts and runs are excluded. Wildcat formation plays are also removed, as they feature unconventional formations and player roles, introducing unnecessary variability. Plays with penalties are also excluded because penalties disrupt the natural flow of the play and can skew player actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data Bowl 2025 focuses on pre-snap insights, so the analysis includes only pre-snap tracking data. All frames before the offense is set are excluded, as there is no need to analyze data from this period. To standardize the data, all plays are adjusted so that the offense faces right. The angles are rotated such that 0º always points to the right, with angles increasing counterclockwise. Speeds are also modified to reflect movement relative to the line of scrimmage (LOS): if a player is moving toward the LOS, their speed is assigned a negative value, while moving away from the LOS results in a positive speed. Lastly, the data is filtered to include only defensive backs (DBs) - specifically safeties and cornerbacks - eliminating all other positions from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train and evaluate the model, the data is split into two sets: weeks 1 through 5 (inclusive) for training and weeks 6 through 9 for testing. This results in **5351 plays in the training set and 3707 in the testing set**. For the training data, only the 1.5 seconds (15 frames) immediately before the ball is snapped are used, focusing on the players' movements just before the snap. Therefore, **all results come from the testing data**, ensuring the model is not used on the data it is trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "The following features were used to train the model. Features marked with an asterisk (*) were excluded from the training of the final model (details in the [appendix](#appendix)). Both **movement-based features** and **contextual features** were used. Movement features capture the players' immediate pre-snap actions (e.g., speed, direction, distance), which help identify whether a player is in position for a blitz. Additionally, **contextual features** consider situational factors (e.g., down, yards to go, score differential) - that help assess whether it makes sense to blitz in a given scenario.\n",

    "\n",
    "The target variable for the model is **wasInitialPassRusher**, which indicates whether the DB was a pass rusher (blitz) for the play (1 = blitz, 0 = no blitz).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "Extreme Gradient Boosting (**XGBoost**) was chosen for this task due to its strong performance in supervised classification problems with large datasets. The model was trained using the following hyperparameters, selected after testing 144 combinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **max_depth**: 9\n",

    "- **Precision**: 33.29%\n",
    "- **Recall**: 22.18%\n",
    "- **Log Loss**: 0.098\n",
    "\n",
    "Although precision and recall may appear low at first glance, these results should not be viewed as poor. The main goal of the model is to predict probabilities, not just class labels. Furthermore, achieving high precision is inherently difficult because DBs are trained to mislead the opponent, making it harder for the model. Consequently, **quantifying uncertainty is essential**, allowing the model to express its confidence in its prediction. Therefore, **log loss** is the most appropriate metric, as it evaluates the accuracy of the model's probability estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further details on the hyperparameter tuning are provided in the [appendix](#appendix).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disguise Score\n",
    "To evaluate how well a defensive back (DB) disguises his intentions, we calculate a **Disguise Score** for each frame in the pre-snap phase of the play. The Disguise Score is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate the disguise score for each frame**:  \n",
    "   For each frame, we compute the disguise score as the absolute difference between the action taken by the DB (blitz = 1, coverage = 0) and the predicted probability of the DB blitzing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{Disguise Score (frame)} = \\left| \\text{Action} - \\text{Predicted Blitz Probability} \\right|\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If the DB is predicted to blitz with a high probability, but the action is coverage (or vice versa), the disguise score will be higher, indicating a stronger disguise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sum and average the disguise scores**:  \n",
    "   After calculating the disguise score for each frame, we sum these scores across all frames in a given play. The total disguise score is then averaged by the number of frames to yield the **Disguise Score** for the entire play:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Disguise Score (play)} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{Disguise Scores (frames)}}{\\text{Number of Frames}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Disguise Score** reflects how effectively the DB hides his intentions in a play. A higher score indicates that the DB is more successful in \"fooling\" the model (and by extension, the offense), while a lower score suggests that the DB's actions are more predictable."
